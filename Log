Day 1: August 25th, 2018 (0 extra hours studied)
Today's Progress: I began the reformatting of this studying system and also began the Conducting project. The progress I made on that today was first reading one project on hand rcognition using OpenCV and then installing Homebrew and OpenCV. I then worked on configuring my laptop and XCode in preparation for some prototyping or testing of concepts in iOS OpenCV.
Thoughts: My laptop is really slow and I should get another 8GB of RAM when that's possible. Also, I don't want to get too dragged down in technical installations if OpenCV's quite difficult; I should transition to a school computer if this gives me much more trouble in getting started with XCode and OpenCV.

Day 2: August 26th, 2018 (0 extra hours studied)
Today's Progress: Installed PyCharm Community as an IDE for testing OpenCV, also cloned an OpenCV repository for XCode although it seems like that won't be needed. Also found two tutorials worth pursuing once everything's installed.
Thoughts: Installing is boring and slow, but by reading ahead in articles and checking other tangents, I managed to feel productive. Hope tomorrow I can run some code on my own machine.

Day 3: August 27th, 2018 (0 extra hours studied)
Today's Progress: Absolutely nothing. Spent an hour trying to install OpenCV into PyCharm, open Jupyter Notebook as an alternative, and overall just had a terrible experience trying to get this to work. If Jupyter doesn't pan out tomorrow, I'm goign to stop trying; it's far too infuriating.
Thoughts: Pissed off because installing something into PyCharm should NOT be this hard. My laptop's stupidly slow as well, so I have no idea what to do other than abandon this tangent if nothing works out.

Day 4: August 28th, 2018 (0 extra hours studied)
Today's Progress: Finally got OpenCV to work by using it in Jupyter Notebook. Opened an image, showed it in-notebook, masked it, and got video webcam feed working too. Tomorrow I'll work on implementing select pixels by mouse-click maybe to select the colors to detect skin with.
Thoughts: It's hella rewarding to finally have some results. This is why I'm doing this work.

Day 5: August 29th, 2018 (1 extra hour studied)
Today's Progress: Continued working on getting video to display well from OpenCV running in a Jupyter Notebook. Tried multiple approaches, few to none worked. I think using the video window that cannot close is likely the best for taking a mouse input, but I should look into the setdata and other mouse options one more time.
Thoughts: Made little progress, but I was building using others' code, so I somehow still felt like I was learning.
Another hour: Continued trying out things with the video player, started looking into ScikitLearn, and also managed to mask my live video as a proof-of-concept. Mouse input seems to be infeasible with the resources I can find now.

Day 6: August 31st, 2018 (0 extra hours studied)
Missed yesterday.
Today's Progress: Completed a video series on decision trees and then began to implement my own coding of decision trees/random forests to classify the Titanic dataset on Kaggle.
Thoughts: Felt like I understood this iteration of decision tree content, might want to fill in the hard parts as I code it out but otherwise don't want to redundantly repeat much more.

Days 7-9: September 3rd, 2018 (-1 extra hours studied)
Missed two days and then made up with two hours today.
Today's Progress: Spent two hours studying pandas dataframe methods in an effort to enable my future development of a random forest to solve Kaggle's Titanic problem.
Thoughts: Shouldn't fall behind again, duh. Still making directional progress though.

Day 10: September 4th, 2018 (-1 extra hours studied, for shame)
Today's Progress: Finished one introduction to pandas, then spent the remainder of the hour studying cross validation techniques, as the Kaggle decision tree article I was trying to follow referenced them.
Thoughts: The rabbit hole grows ever deeper, but at least I'm still learning new things. Might want Shiffman or deep-fried memes soon.

Days 11 and 12: September 6th, 2018 (-1 extra hours studied, for shame)
Today's Progress: Spent two hours working through more of the Random Forests paper for Deep Dive 1. I felt like I was getting most of the initial math, and definitely on my way to understanding the algorithm itself. Now I'm about halfway through the essay, hope I can finish it soon.
Thoughts: Feeling good about my understanding and glad I fit two hours into one day. Maybe it helps to catch up a bit, or at least avoid falling behind further.

Days 13 and 14: September 8th, 2018 (-2 extra hours studied, for extra shame)
Today's Progress: Continuing through the random forests paper while struggling to stay awake, practically. The latter half is getting dense and I knew to skip certain math parts, but tomorrow I'll need to buckle down and read over the bits I skipped, at least broadly.
Thoughts: This paper's definitely getting old and I'd prefer to do something more interesting.

Days 15 and 16: September 10th, 2018 (-2 extra hours studied, for extra shame)
Today's Progress: Spent one hour on the random forest paper and one hour on deep fried meme research. Currently defining the goals for my project and its metrics for success.
Thoughts: Memes are fun and there's a surprising amount of work I could put into a Meme Deep Frier if I went all-in.
