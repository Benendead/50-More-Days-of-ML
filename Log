Day 1: August 25th, 2018 (0 extra hours studied)
Today's Progress: I began the reformatting of this studying system and also began the Conducting project. The progress I made on that today was first reading one project on hand rcognition using OpenCV and then installing Homebrew and OpenCV. I then worked on configuring my laptop and XCode in preparation for some prototyping or testing of concepts in iOS OpenCV.
Thoughts: My laptop is really slow and I should get another 8GB of RAM when that's possible. Also, I don't want to get too dragged down in technical installations if OpenCV's quite difficult; I should transition to a school computer if this gives me much more trouble in getting started with XCode and OpenCV.

Day 2: August 26th, 2018 (0 extra hours studied)
Today's Progress: Installed PyCharm Community as an IDE for testing OpenCV, also cloned an OpenCV repository for XCode although it seems like that won't be needed. Also found two tutorials worth pursuing once everything's installed.
Thoughts: Installing is boring and slow, but by reading ahead in articles and checking other tangents, I managed to feel productive. Hope tomorrow I can run some code on my own machine.

Day 3: August 27th, 2018 (0 extra hours studied)
Today's Progress: Absolutely nothing. Spent an hour trying to install OpenCV into PyCharm, open Jupyter Notebook as an alternative, and overall just had a terrible experience trying to get this to work. If Jupyter doesn't pan out tomorrow, I'm goign to stop trying; it's far too infuriating.
Thoughts: Pissed off because installing something into PyCharm should NOT be this hard. My laptop's stupidly slow as well, so I have no idea what to do other than abandon this tangent if nothing works out.

Day 4: August 28th, 2018 (0 extra hours studied)
Today's Progress: Finally got OpenCV to work by using it in Jupyter Notebook. Opened an image, showed it in-notebook, masked it, and got video webcam feed working too. Tomorrow I'll work on implementing select pixels by mouse-click maybe to select the colors to detect skin with.
Thoughts: It's hella rewarding to finally have some results. This is why I'm doing this work.
