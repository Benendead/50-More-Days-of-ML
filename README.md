# 50-More-Days-of-ML
The rules are simple: 50 more days. 1 hour per day of ML-related studying.

I'm continuing the 100 Days of ML challenge, just refocusing and making sure that I don't repeat past mistakes.

Goals for these 50 days (to be updated over time):
* Complete the Deep Dive 1 project, where I'm reading through every single source on a seminal research paper in the field of ML before creating a summary of all that I've learned from the process.
* Complete the Composing Project (started 8/25/2018), where I'm going to work on creating a computer vision application to track hands for use in creating more human-sounding MIDI and allowing variable conducted tempos/dynamics in my own eventual composing application.
* Code my own solution to the classification of the Titanic data set on Kaggle using the random forest algorithm.
* Design a robotic arm that can move smoothly in 3d space with full rotational ability. Then apply deep reinforcement learning to this system.
BONUS:
This is with the UDSC at my college, so I'm obligated to include:
* Develop a solution the Kaggle's MNIST classification challenge. Code it out yourself, but using popular libraries. I must understand all ML algorithms I use in any solutions.

Additional Rules:
* Extra hours can be tracked and allowed to make up for future missed days. This should not work in reverse, but of course it will.
* Entries must be made at least every two days, even if I'm behind on the research hours.
* Each day must specifically work towards one of my specified goals. If no interesting goal exists, focus and create a new one that's worth renewing my efforts towards completing.
* Maximum of four goals at any given time.
* Goals must be completed with either success or clear failure to produce results AFTER a genuine attempt has been made.
* ONLY machine learning topics can be studied during this time, with clear application to my specified goals.
